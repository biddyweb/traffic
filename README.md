Traffic
====

A project for CS032 to draw maps to screen, calculate shortest paths and give directions.

##TODO##
- BufferedWriter not PrintWriter so sending traffic will cancel closed clients
- Hashmap for traffic data (for the routes too)
- Traffic connecting statically (not just constructor)
- ID thing for routing (ID already exists in the header)
- Error checking!!!
- Testing
